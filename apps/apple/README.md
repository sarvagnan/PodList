# PodList Apple

Phase 2, milestone 1: the shared domain and local data foundation. Swift 6 language mode,
macOS 26 and iOS 26 minimums, no third-party packages. The installed Swift 6.4 toolchain
builds this package. There is no UI or application target yet.

## Build and test

From this directory, keep the compiler module caches inside the worktree:

```sh
export CLANG_MODULE_CACHE_PATH="$PWD/.build/module-cache"
export SWIFTPM_MODULECACHE_OVERRIDE="$PWD/.build/module-cache"
swift build --scratch-path .build
swift test --scratch-path .build
```

In an agent sandbox that cannot launch SwiftPM's nested sandbox, use:

```sh
swift build --scratch-path .build --disable-sandbox \
  --cache-path .build/cache --config-path .build/config --security-path .build/security
swift test --scratch-path .build --disable-sandbox \
  --cache-path .build/cache --config-path .build/config --security-path .build/security
```

The second form also keeps SwiftPM's configuration, security directory and manifest cache
inside `.build/`. It disables SwiftPM's nested sandbox; the enclosing agent sandbox still
applies. `.build/` and `.swiftpm/` are ignored by git.

## Modules

- **PodListDomain** uses Foundation only. Codable, Equatable, Sendable protocol types;
  Operations and every Change; State replay with explicit deduplication; Playlists,
  Entries, Cursor, History, Trash, Clear on Played, Positions, Listening Timeline,
  Rewind, Views, Download Rules and Playback Settings. `Listening` measures local-day
  listening amounts; `ListeningSession` produces Changes at playback boundaries.
  `ViewRules` evaluates a Library in memory using the pinned Unicode 17 Mentions fold.
- **PodListData** imports the SDK's system `SQLite3` module. `LocalDatabase` is an actor
  owning its SQLite connection, scoped migrations, Library upserts, State documents and
  indexes, stable Device identity, sequence, outbox and separate confirmed State/cursors.
  Related edits and pull commits are transactional. `ViewQuery` binds filter values and
  orders ties using SQLite's binary collation. Shared and client migrations are checked
  against TypeScript and Kotlin sources, including the Mentions backfill.
- **SyncClient** is an actor with coalesced runs and a `SyncTransport` protocol. Registration
  retries preserve the Device; push retries preserve Operations; successful pulls acknowledge
  only the sent outbox snapshot and replay intervening local edits. Library paging continues
  independently of State failures. Episodes arriving before their Subscription wait, with the
  durable Library cursor held back until they can be written. No HTTP runs in a transaction.
  `HttpTransport` uses URLSession without credentials, cookies or redirects. Server addresses
  require an HTTPS origin, with an explicit localhost HTTP option for development.
- **FeedParser** uses Foundation's streaming XML parser for RSS, enclosure and chapter-source
  metadata, publisher dates and durations. It rejects DTD/entity declarations and feeds over
  32 MiB measured as UTF-8 bytes.
- **ProtocolTestSupport** is an internal test helper target. Fixtures are found by walking
  upward from `#filePath` to `packages/domain/protocol`; no vectors are copied or bundled.

The current contract has only `pwa`, `desktop` and `android` Device kinds. This package
registers as `desktop` with the name “PodList Apple”; it introduces no Apple-specific wire
value. `MarkSubscriptionPlayed` and `SetSubscriptionOverrides` remain server intentions in
shared replay. A Standalone Device database expands them locally and stores local Operations
without putting them in the server outbox.

## Verification

`swift test` exercises all 21 operation-vector files, every checkpoint, Operation/State JSON
round-trips and duplicate delivery; all 4 cumulative server logs; all 68 View cases both in
memory and against SQLite; 25 listening samples, 11 Played thresholds and 2 listening sessions;
and all 12 RSS and 16 duration cases. Every vector State also round-trips through SQLite and
its Entry index. Coverage checks detect a new contract document or Change tag without a runner.

Offline transport tests cover registration retry, lost push responses, edits recorded during
pull, separate State/Library failures and cursors, Library paging across restart, waiting
Episodes, malformed cursor progression, unresolved Subscriptions, failed-pull acknowledgement,
and Listening log deduplication across restart. Database tests cover durable sequences, atomic
rollback, nested savepoints, schema drift and migration backfill over multiple batches.

No shared vector needed changing. Tests use offline transports; live server networking has
not been exercised.

## Next

Milestone 2 is the Mac window layout and read-only Library, Views and Playlists wired to sync.
The owner is choosing between mock-ups; do not build UI before that choice. Platform lifecycle
sync scheduling and reader notifications belong with that app integration. Audio playback,
download execution, native menus, App Intents and the Mac MCP server remain later milestones.
Standalone feed polling, directory search, Subscribe/Unsubscribe, OPML, bringing a Library to a
server, and publisher Chapter fetching are not ported in this foundation package; RSS parsing
and the persistent schema are ready for that work. Android's UI/action helpers are not ported.
